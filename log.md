### Day 1: December 16th, 2020 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: 
Worked on my first medium level Leet Code Problem. Sean navigated and helped me out and it took us about an hour. 
I'm going to continue working on my blog and make at least one more commit with my Chat Cat project.

**Thoughts** 
I need to tell myself that it's ok to be where I am at in terms of my skill. I'm learning and growing as a coder. There is a progression.
