### Day 2: December 7th, 2020 Monday 

**Today's Progress**: 
• Solved my 2nd LeetCode problem: "Two Sum" 
• Started learning how to create JS websocket using stream chat
• Created a new repository to practice websockets called "Chat Cat" 

**Thoughts:** 
• I didn't get quite as much done as i wanted to today. But I am excited about getting started with websockets. I got uuid to work for the first time. Now I need to start thinking about blogs that I want to work on. Maybe I'll do a harder LeetCode problem tomorrow.
